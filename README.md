Travel Buddy acts as a tool that guides the group travellers through the planning and execution of their trip itineraries. Travel Buddy emphasizes the locational tracking of members and regrouping by combining the primary features of itinerary planning apps such as Tripit in consolidating and sharing an ordered itinerary and mapped route as well as privacy protected location tracking and group meetup assistance in apps lile Glympse and FindMyFriends.

To use this app, download and import into Android Studio and then run it.  It was tested using a Nexus 4 API 24 and a Nexus 5.
